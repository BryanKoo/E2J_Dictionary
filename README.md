# English2Japanese Dictionary
Vocabulary learning is one of the first thing to do for learning any foreign languages.

We can build English vocabulary learning content based on data structure as below.
* English word (string)
  1 example phrases/sentences in English (strings)
  2 meaning of the word (images)
  3 equivalant word(s) in foreign language (string)

When we build above English vocabulary learning contents for multiple other languages, the first two records will be the same for all. Only the third record should be prepared for each language.
The third record is not the full explanation of the English word but short equivalent word(s) in foreign language.
I am going to build English dictionaries for multiple other languages in programmatic way for the third record.
Japanese is the first and other asian languages will be followed.

## Homograph and Polysemes (from the definition of wikipedia)
Homographs are words that have two or more different meanings.
Two types of homographs are homonym and heteronym, distinguished by the prononciation.
An example of homonym is tire and an example of heteronym is desert.
A polyseme is a word or phrase with different, but related senses.
Offline dictionaries have sepereted entry for homographs and united entry for polysemes.
But some online dictionary like Wiktionary does not follow this policy, it has only one entry for homograph.
Our dictinary follow the same policy as offline dictionaries because it is better for vocabulary learning.
It is assumed that the difference of Homograph policy is post-processed manually.

## Software requiremants for the projects
* Language utilities for the native/foreign language (Japanese, English)
  * alphabet check, symbol replacement, locale, etc.,
* Scrapers for on-line dictionaries
  * english dictionary which has japanese translation (wiktionary)
  * japanese dictionary (wiktionary, koto, weblio)
* Word selector
  * extract native explanations for each word of the foreign language
    * 1 or more etymologies > 1 or more pos's(part of speech) > 1 or more corresponding native words
  * choose a few representative words from many candidates
  * neet to process special symbols to connect each meaning (, : ;) in dictionaries
  * need to define policy for choosing representative word
  * common policy is choosing short word
  * preferences for japanese are kanji > hiragana > katagana > english

## External resources
### wikt2dict https://github.com/juditacs/wikt2dict
The document format for wiktionary is wikimedia.
English wikitionary in xml file can be downloaded from the wikimedia archive.
With wikt2dict, we can get xml parsed wikimedia files for multiple languages at once.
However, it is needed to add some code in config.py for downloading wiktionary of asian countries.

### Unihan_IRGSources.txt
Wiktionary is user-generated dictionary and thus it has lots of errors.
One type of error for Japanese string is using wrong kanji, which is usually from Chinese simplified character set.
The file has the information about the dictionary source of each han character for each asian country.
We can check for each unified han character whether they are used in Japanese or not with the file.
The file is included in the following zip file. http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/Unihan.zip

### Online Japanese dictionaries (for English words)
There is possibility that we cannot get all translation from the Wiktionary.
We can use online Japanese dictionary services for English words.
Because this project needs short translating words, one service has selected and prepared for crawling.

## How to execute
1. download python files.
2. prepare dictionary
   * create a sub directory /words and put a text file all_words.csv where each line has a english word to be translated.
   * create a sub directory /dict for the dictionary and put english and japanese wiktionary with help of wikt2dict.
   *  crawl online Japanese dictionary.
3. extract translations from dictionary
4. build the output dictionary that has simple equivalent Japanese words for each English word
